Text Processing and Data Management Tool Documentation
Project Overview
The Text Processing and Data Management Tool is designed to facilitate various text manipulation operations, including search, replace, and data management using Java collections. The project emphasizes collaboration within a Scrum team, adhering to Git and GitHub workflows, and maintaining high standards of code quality and documentation.
Technologies Used
•	Java JDK 21
•	Maven
•	JavaFX
Project Objectives
•	Implement Scrum processes within the project workflow.
•	Integrate Git and GitHub workflows using Gitflow branching strategy.
•	Facilitate effective collaboration and communication among team members.
•	Enforce guidelines for writing descriptive commit messages.
•	Evaluate engineers' adherence to Scrum processes, GitHub workflows, and collaborative practices.
•	Use regular expressions (regex) to search, match, and replace text patterns.
•	Understand the fundamentals of Java collections (ArrayList, Set, Map) and their usages.
•	Create user interfaces using JavaFX for interaction with the text processing tool.
•	Testing
